### Best Papers

<details><summary>List</summary>

**From Microfacets to Participating Media: A Unified Theory of Light Transport With Stochastic Geometry**
Authors: Dario Seyb, Eugene d’Eon, Benedikt Bitterli, Wojciech Jarosz
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
We derive a theory of light transport on stochastic implicit surfaces, a geometry model capable of expressing deterministic geometry, microfacet surfaces, participating media, and an exciting new continuum in between containing aggregate appearance, non-classical media, and more. Our model naturally supports spatial correlations, missing from most existing stochastic models.

**Walkin’ Robin: Walk on Stars With Robin Boundary Conditions**
Authors: Bailey Miller, Rohan Sawhney, Keenan Crane, Ioannis Gkioulekas
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
We develop a grid-free Monte Carlo method for solving boundary value problems like the Poisson equation with Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions. Unlike conventional PDE solvers, our method does not require volumetric meshing or global solves. It is robust, embarrassingly parallel, scalable to complex geometry, and allows view-dependent evaluation.

**Repulsive Shells**
Authors: Josua Sassen, Henrik Schumacher, Martin Rumpf, Keenan Crane
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
Shape spaces are a powerful tool for nonlinear interpolation, extrapolation, and averaging of geometric data, but previous shape spaces permit geometry to self-intersect in nonphysical ways. We introduce a shape space where geometry naturally avoids intersection, as well as an adaptive collision potential that prevents collision while converging under refinement.

**Lightning-Fast Method of Fundamental Solutions**
Authors: Jiong Chen, Florian Schäfer, Mathieu Desbrun
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
This work introduces a variational preconditioner, based on the inverse Cholesky factorization, to improve the efficiency of solving dense systems discretized from boundary integral equations, effectively addressing the scalability issue commonly encountered in boundary-based approaches.
</details><br>

**Robust Containment Queries Over Collections of Rational Parametric Curves via Generalized Winding Numbers**
Authors: Jacob Spainhour, David Gunderman, Kenneth Weiss
<details><summary>Summary</summary>
We extend the theory of generalized winding numbers to unstructured collections of rational parametric curves with a numerically stable algorithm, thereby allowing for robust and accurate containment classifications at arbitrary locations for non-watertight and self-intersecting shapes.

## 2. Trends

### Real-Time Rendering and Gaming (from Advances opening remarks)

#### Player Expectations

- Narrative-driven experiences
- Cross-platform plays
- Live service models
- Scale and immersion
- Low Latency > Fidelity in multiplayer games
- High demand for more & better in Gfx
  - 4K 120FPS in next
- Getting high fidelity from less
- Untethered devices are trending

### Gaming Technology & Platform Trends

- Increase HW fragmentation
  - Min-spec is not rising anywhere fast enough.
  - [Gen8-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles) specs aren't going anywhere.
- Desire for fast runtime GI
  - Continuous effort to improve fast runtime GI and provide fast baking iteration.
  - Scalability for platform ecosystem is a must.
- Atomic rendering primitives optionally abounds
  - Splats, triangles, rays have been converging and intermixing.
- More interest in spatio-temporal upscaling and VRS
  - Extreme pressure on frame cost generates stronger interest in frame resue + larger resolutions drive cost up.
- Dense large levels proliferate
  - GPU-driven has been adopted and proven a win.
  - Visibility buffer gaining ground.
  - CPU/GPU work graphs and work generation on GPUs gaining ground.
  - Example - Brainerd: Tessellation in CoD: Ghosts (SIGGRAPH Advances 2014)
  - Challenge: Disk footprint
- Hybrid ray tracing has taken a foothold and is not going anywhere
  - Continuous effort to improve fast runtime GI and provide fast baking iteration.
  - Scalability for platform ecosystem is a must.
    - E.g. Denoiser
- Continued evolution of compute based graphics is exciting
  - From GPU-driven pipeline workloads, spatio-temporal upscaling, to ML-based algorithms execution on device, we're generalizing CS-based workflows more and more.

### Runtime Machine Learning

- ML techniques are well suited for compression of high-dimensional datasets for runtime use
  - Simulation: Animation/Deformation
  - Global illumination
  - VFX and etc.
- ML upscalers proliferate **but beware of blackbox systems**
  - IHVs are excited about the value ML upscalers provide.
  - Developers are challenged by blackbox systems and need for custom training.
- ML-based animation and deformation is the new SSAO
  - Tricky to get right, forever chasing minute artifacts;
  - Content-dependent;
  - Yet once there, you can't go back
- ML programming model still evolving
  - NPU programming models are not crisp yet.
  - Much ML innovation at runtime executes on cross-platform compute shaders.

## 3. Trends in AI Graphics (from an HPG keynote)

### Emerging Trends

- Consumer-level GPU
- Rendering tasks other than post-processing
- Thread-scale problems
  - Rather than GPU-scale problems
- Small neural networks, by design
  - For performance reasons

#### Examples from recent NV research

**Neural Texture Compression (2023)**
- Small MLP to decompress stacks of material properties textures
  - 1 MLP network per material texture stack
  - 2 hidden layers
  - 4-16x compression improvement over standard BC (block compressed textures)

**Real-Time Neural Apprearance Models (2024)**
- Small MLPs to represent layered material params and approximate scattering math
  - 2 MLP networks (BRDF eval & importance sampling) per material.
  - 2-3 hidden layers
  - 2-4x performance improvement

**NeuralVDB (2024)**
- Represent both compressed volume data and sparse tree topology
  - 2-4 MLP networks per volume
  - 3-4 hidden layers
  - 10-100x compression ratio

**Neural Radiance Cache (2021)**
- Neural network encodes sampled radiance information
  - 1 MLP network per probe
  - 2 hidden layers
  - Radiance probes updated (training) and queried (inference) dynamically

#### Simple MLPs are surprisingly powerful
- Data compression
- Approximation of complex math
- Caching of complex signal data

#### Performance can be competitive with traditional rendering
- Layer fusion
- Leveraging reduced precision and sparsity

#### Challenges
- Divergence
  - E.g. Each SM is querying on its own networks, or own texel values, etc.
- Intermix with traditional shader code

Even MLP examples are leveraging enacode/decoder pairs and learned, latent space representations.

### Will AI just render the whole image?
- Questions to ask ourselves
  - What will be the source for high-quality training data?
  - How will we make it:
    - Stable
    - Reproducible
    - Interactive
    - Real-time
  - How will it interact with traditional rendering?
- Example: OpenAI video created with Sora (2024)
  - Implicit understanding of physics, e.g. dust cloud
  - Generated from a text prompt
  - Probably not the solution to our question

#### Creation, Representation, Rendering
- AI will disrupt all industries and fields of study
  - Content creation and complexity
  - Render performance and quality

## 4. Labs and Exibitions

- Real-time GI
  - Similar to UE5's "Valley of the Ancients" demo with GI/day-night cycle/light shafts/etc
