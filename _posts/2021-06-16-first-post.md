I was finally able to build my blog site and host it through GitHub Pages. Though it took me a while to set up everything needed (esp. for Windows), it was totally worth it and the website now looks great. I will definitely suggest you check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and some [theme templates](http://jekyllthemes.org/) if you also have some plan of building a simple blog site.

This will be a place for me share my thoughts on graphics programming / rendering / game dev. Since this is the first post, there's nothing to say other than claming that I'm saying something :D For the next post, I am planning to talk about Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows (or PCSS), how I implemented the technique with shaders, and some analysis regarding its strengths and weaknesses.
